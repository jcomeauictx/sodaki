# Sodaki
A language for systems thinking

I awoke early on the morning of 2025-01-19 from a dream in which I was shown
the cover of a book, _SODAKI: A language for systems thinking_. It had a white
cover with a grid of black boxes, some missing (or was it white on black?
not sure). I didn't see my name as the author, and while in the dream I had
no sense that I was (the author). But when I searched later, I found a
reference to a [defi app](https://www.cypherhunter.com/en/p/sodaki/), which
pointed to the url <https://sodaki.com>. I then checked, and the domain
wasn't registered! So I grabbed it, and will make it my mission to become the
systems thinker required to write such a book.
